        <p>
            As a CS major at UMich, Iâ€™ve encountered my fair share of challenging projects. However, none have pushed my limits and
            caused more hair-pulling bugs like my recent stock market project covering priority queues and algorithm design. I look
            back in horror at how many hours I invested into perfecting it, but also with gratitude, as it drove me to understand
            the underlying concepts very well.
        </p>
        <p>
            My task was to develop a system that could manage buy and sell orders efficiently, using custom comparators and priority
            queues to simulate the flow of the stock market. In addition, I had to keep tracking of median purchase prices for individual stocks and
            implement a "time traveler" that knew at what timestamp to buy and sell a stock to yield maximum profit.
            I used the standard C++ "priority_queue" template for this portion. My final task was to implement my own template for a
            sorted array priority queue, a binary heap priority queue, and a pairing heap priority queue.
            I was also given runtime and memory usage restrictions, which added another layer of complexity to the project.
        </p>
        <p> 
            It took me around 4 days to complete the actual functionality of the project, ignoring the restrictions on efficiency.
            This was decently straightforward, just time-consuming due to the amount of logic that had to be written. However, it
            then took me another 5 days to meet the runtime and memory restrictions, despite the functionality being correct. During
            this time, I was forced to scour my code for any possible way to shave off even milliseconds from my runtime. This meant
            rewriting algorithms to run in O(logn) instead of O(n), finding better ways to manipulate input strings, eliminating
            duplicate code, etc.

            Further, testing my code proved to be unintuitive. A correct sorted array is easy to identify, but a correct max-heap
            given a random array of 30 custom "Stock" objects is a different story.
        </p>
        <p>
            But after some long nights and visits to office hours, I was able to complete the project on the day it was due. I'm
            grateful for how much I learned, but also thanking god that it's over. For my next project, I'm going to focus on coding
            intuitively - this means naming variables and functions more descriptively - and writing more comments. Doing this well
            would have made my debugging process much less arduous. I'll also do myself a favor and start earlier.
