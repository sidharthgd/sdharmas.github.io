            I first delved into chess during quarantine as yet another way to distract myself during the long, dry days in bed. I
            was terrible, of course, but I slowly got better the more I played.
            It was around that time that The Queens Gambit was released on Netflix. I bingewatched the whole series in about 3 days,
            and that only further sparked my interest in the game. I started watching YouTubers like GothamChess and Daniel
            Naroditsky. Through hundreds of games played and hours of opening tutorials, I became further enamored by the game. I
            would play while I ate, at the gym, on the toilet, and anywhere else I’d get some free time.
            Fast forward to today, and I’ve grown in rating from 400 to about 1300. That’s not a crazy rating at all, but it’s a lot
            of progress and I have no intention of quitting. This newfound passion for chess sparked my latest project idea. I’m
            developing a website that showcases the vast array of openings in chess, and the dozens of branches that each family of
            openings entails. I’m hoping to release the intial version by November 30th, 2024.
